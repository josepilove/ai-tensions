- Complexity Sherpas (Fractional Chief AI Officer):
Your Chief AI Office / Team of Experts At Your Service
AI will transform how work gets done across every facet of your company, if not today then tomorrow.
No one knows how fast things will change, but already AI has advanced to the point where some teams
are doubling and tripling their productivity by integrating AI into their workflows.
The seeds of change are there, but it is not simple or easy to leverage AI.
With AI, more so than most technologies, peak success relies on people working together in new ways to
access and leverage your organizationʼs unique experience, knowledge, and data. Working across
boundaries and low data maturity is always a big challenge. With AI the journey is akin to climbing a
mountain with weather that changes by the hour!
You need to prepare, train, and journey with expert guidance. You need a complexity sherpa.
Like a sherpa helps mountaineers climb the Himalayas, The Understanding Group (TUG) will guide you
on your AI journey. Weʼll prepare you, train you, and set a pace for the journey that youʼre able to absorb.
Weʼll serve as your own Chief AI Officer guiding you on your way and delivering:
● AI Readiness Assessment establishing your current baseline.
● Workshops that educate your team on how AI can amplify how work gets done.
● Shared Vision across your team for how AI can serve your strategic objectives
● Governance, ROI Tracking, Compliance, and Risk policies that are aligned with your culture
● Objective SWOT analysis of your strengths and weaknesses, opportunities/ROI and threats
● A Playbook that prioritizes how to fulfill opportunities and manage threats
We offer three basic paths depending on where you are now with your journey:
♦—Slow: You know AI is coming and need to get started on the journey
♦♦—Moderate: Youʼve started exploring AI and want to start deploying solutions soon.
♦♦♦—Accelerated: Youʼre ready to go and want to implement solutions ASAP
Most companies will achieve immediate ROI from employee productivity improvements. But the real
wins come from integrating AI into systems and workflows, and the time to achieve this depends on
where youʼre starting from and the pace you choose for the journey.
Start your journey with a Readiness Assessment (starting at $3,000). Monthly guidance starts at $1,000/month.

What it's like to work with TUG
TUG always begins by determining what needs to be done before determining
how to do it. Every project with TUG follows a simple but effective pattern: Align
on a Good Outcome, Understand the Real Problem, and Create a Good Solution.
Aligning on a Good Outcome
You can expect facilitated sessions to elicit, clarify, and align on what you want from AI. These
can be broad discussions, defining a holistic AI strategy, or narrow, focusing on specific
targets for AI deployment. Visual models throughout will facilitate alignment.
Deliverables: A tangible, shared understanding amongst all stakeholders—of what needs to
happen, why it is important, who will be affected, and what a successful outcome looks
like—this streamlines decision-making and communication. In the end, your leadership will
be aligned around what you want and what it means to succeed.
Understanding the Real Problem
You can expect facilitated sessions with the people closest to the problems to establish clarity
around needs and the problem domain. Whether exploring individual workflows or entire
ecosystems, models help ensure the correct and entire problem is being addressed.
Deliverables: Alignment across TUG and the people who best know the problem will ensure
the solution is a good fit. Our modeling is widely regarded for its ability to facilitate a shared
understanding of a domain. In the end, you will have a set of models that align all parties
around the unique situation that needs to be solved for your organization.
Create a Good Solution
You can expect TUG to develop holistic structures that address the entire problem space. This
involves creating lightweight prototypes of workflows, data structures, and inputs that are
easily validated and iterated upon. We produce a series of models and diagrams that outline a
structured approach for transforming processes and information, ensuring the solution fits
seamlessly into your organization.
Deliverables: Models of the proposed solution enable discussion, alignment, and evaluation
before it is implemented. Once the solution is validated, TUG will facilitate its implementation,
both technically and through training. In the end, youʼll have solutions aligned with your
organizationʼs aim, addressing the right problems, and immediately useful to your team.
